1. Please remove the debug panel from the entire project.

2. In the Blog section, new blog posts are not displaying after submission. Please fix the issue.

3. On the Homepage, add an option to change the background image for the section that shows:
   “Explore Our Products” and “Discover Our Passion for RC Products.”

4. On the Cart page, the "Proceed to Checkout" and "Continue Shopping" buttons need a little space between them (not mandatory but would look better).

5. In the Admin Dashboard, please review the Users section — it seems to be using static data instead of actual data from the database.

6. During account creation, it seems the user is not being saved to the database — please verify and fix this if needed.

7. Maybe Picture is not adding on Database.

7. If you notice anything else that needs improvement or fixing, feel free to change or update it.
